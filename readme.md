**Industrial Park** is an archive viewer and editor for the following Heavy Iron Studios games:

* SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle For Bikini Bottom
* The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Game
* Scooby-Doo: Night of 100 Frights
* The Incredibles
* The Incredibles: Rise of the Underminer
* Ratatouille (January 18th, 2006 Prototype)

for the following platforms:

* GameCube
* Xbox
* Playstation 2
* PC (Incredibles and ROTU only)

The tool (whose namesake is one of the levels in Battle For Bikini Bottom) can create, open, display, extract data from, edit and save the HIP/HOP archive files used in the games and contains multiple functions to aid on custom level creation; it's essentially a very fancy GUI for the [HipHopFile library](https://github.com/igorseabra4/HipHopTool). It was used by video game developer [Purple Lamp Studios](https://www.purplelamp.com/) during the development of [SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom - Rehydrated](https://www.purplelamp.com/projects/spongebob-squarepants-rehydrated/) to aid on extracting data from the original game.
